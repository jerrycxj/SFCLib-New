SFCLib

To address these challenges, we will design and implement an efficient and scalable space-filling curve library for nD point cloud management.
Multi dimensions support (xyt, xyz, xyzt, xyzi, ….) ;
 Multi SFC encoding schema (value, hashstring,….);
 Multi query support and integration of different databases;
 Scalability for massive point datasets.
 Performance experiments on LiDAR point cloud, GPS trajectory data, ……
